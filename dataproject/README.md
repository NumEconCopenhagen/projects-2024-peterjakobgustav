# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Air traffic passengers** and is about how the economic and technological evolution on a global scale has influenced the number of air passenger between 1970 and 2021. The project also aims to differentiate which areas of the world are the most common users of air travel and how the global pandemic affected the numbers of travelers.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. dataX.csv (*source*) 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install numpy``
``pip install pandas``
``pip install matplotlib``
``pip install geopandas``
``pip install ipywidgets``
