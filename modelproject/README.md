# Solow Model Analysis Project

Our project is titled **Solow Model** and is about demonstrating the structure and components of a model analysis project. This project specifically focuses on the Solow economic growth model.

The `modelproject.py` file includes a function which could be used multiple times in this notebook.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

### Files in the Project

1. **modelproject.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and results.
2. **modelproject.py**: Python script with the `SolowModel` class, which includes functions for economic parameter initialization and simulations.

### Usage

To run the project and see the results, open and execute the `modelproject.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
