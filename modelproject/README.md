# Solow and MRW Model Analysis Project

Our project is titled **Solow and MRW Model** and is about demonstrating the structure and components of a model analysis project. This project specifically focuses on the Solow economic growth model and its extension, the Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) model, which incorporates human capital.

The `modelproject.py` file includes functions and classes which could be used multiple times in this notebook.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages. The project uses `sympy` for symbolic computation and `matplotlib` for plotting.

### Files in the Project

1. **modelproject.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and results.
2. **modelproject.py**: Python script with the `SolowModel` and `HumanCapital` classes, which include functions for economic parameter initialization, simulations, and analytical solutions.

### Usage

To run the project and see the results, open and execute the `modelproject.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

### Key Components

- **Solow Model**: Demonstrates the structure and dynamics of the Solow economic growth model.
- **MRW Model**: Extends the Solow model by incorporating human capital, providing a more comprehensive understanding of economic growth.
- **Simulation and Analytical Solutions**: Includes simulations of both models and analytical solutions for the MRW model, highlighting the impact of human capital on economic development.

### Conclusion

Throughout this project, we explored the dynamics of the Solow Growth Model and extended it to the Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) model by incorporating human capital. By simulating various economic scenarios, we demonstrated how the extended model provides a more comprehensive understanding of economic growth. The robust framework of both models allowed us to appreciate the critical roles of capital accumulation, labor growth, technological advancement, and policy interventions in shaping long-term economic growth. Additionally, the MRW model's inclusion of human capital highlighted the significant impact of education and skills development on an economy's trajectory, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms driving sustained economic progress.
